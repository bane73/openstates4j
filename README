Note: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN FLUX.


REQUIREMENTS

	In order to use this project, you must first acquire a Sunlight Labs API Key.
	You can obtain a key by visiting http://services.sunlightlabs.com

	You should also review the Open States API documentation, as this interface
	is only meant to provide a thin wrapper it and should (hopefully) closely
	mirror it.
	The API documentation can be found at http://openstates.org/api/


KNOWN LIMITATIONS

	Note that all of the Objects represented by the API are similarly represented
	by this wrapper, with the exception of the State-Metadata object.


EXAMPLE

	OpenStates.setApiKey( {YOUR_SUNLIGHT_LABS_API_KEY} );
	
	// find all Districts for the state of California
	List<District> allCaliforniaDistricts = District.find( "ca" );
	
	// find all NY's upper-house Bills that have been updated since 01Jan2012
	Map<String, String> queryParams = new HashMap<String, String>();
	queryParams.put( "state", "ny" );
	queryParams.put( "updated_since", "2012-01-01" );
	queryParams.put( "chamber", "upper" );
	List<Bill> allRecentBillsInNyUpperHouse = Bill.find( queryParams );

	// find a specific Bill
	Bill aBill = allRecentBillsInNyUpperHouse.get(0);
	Bill targetBill = Bill.get( aBill.state, aBill.session, aBill.id );
	
	// finding Legislator's that represent a specific geo-area
	List<Legislator> geoLegislators = Legislator.find( "-78.76648", "35.81336" );
	
	// accessing a Legislator's properties
	String id = Legislator.id;
	String fullName = Legislator.fullName;
	String email = Legislator.email;
	boolean isActive = Legislator.isActive;
